Greetings everyone,

I am Taha Ahmad and do just go by my first name. While school is in session I can be contacted through my CUNY email address of Taha.Ahmad25@spsmail.cuny.edu. At the moment I am not currently employed and am focusing on MSDS full-time, but previously I worked in cybersecurity as a cybersecurity engineer. I wanted to move away from the cybersecurity field, which is why I began this program. I'd say my career objectives would involve working with product user data to optimize acquisition and retention.

I am most comfortable with Python as I have used it for personal projects, business projects, and school projects. However, I have come to enjoy working in R through MSDS classes. My stint with Java Script was fairly unproductiv when attempted somewhere around a decade ago, so the comfort there would not be high. SQL and PowerShell are another two languages that I am experienced and comfortable with (but I don't foresee much PowerShell use in this class!). Like Johnny, I have also taken a class on utilizing ArcGIS for mapping and thoroughly enjoyed how different it feels from traditional data analysis.

Finally, the skills that I would like to get out of this class are less the hard coding skills for how to visualize data, but moreso how to differentiate which data is important for your audience and what to focus on from your dataset. These are skills that I feel like I have not had much time to develop being relatively new to the data analysis/science field. I look forward to seeing what everyone else has to say and the rest of the semester!
